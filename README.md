Welcome to my code playground! I'm a curious developer who loves diving into various projects and technologies. Here's a bit about what you might find in my repositories:
## What I'm Up To:

- 🚀 **Gaming Servers:** Crafting servers for platforms like RageMP. From game logic to server management, it's all in the mix.

- 🎮 **Game Development:** Occasionally venturing into the world of game development, using Unity or Godot.

- 🌐 **Web Development:** Building web applications and experimenting with different stacks. Vite + Vue.js is a personal favorite.

- 🤓 **C++ Exploration:** Occasionally trying my hand at C++. It's a journey, and I'm embracing the learning curve.

## Current Projects:

- 🕹️ [Javascript - RageMP Roleplay Server](link-to-your-repo): A roleplay server created to be as realistic as possible.

- 🌟 [Vue - Company Simulator](link-to-your-repo): Creating a website where you create and manage different business's

## Fun Fact:

I believe in the power of exploration, so you'll find a variety of projects here. From gaming realms to coding puzzles, it's all part of the adventure!


🚧 **Disclaimer:** Most of my projects are a space for experimentation, learning, and sometimes just having fun with code. As a result, the quality of the code may vary, and it might not always meet industry best practices.
